Installation of Mandel 0.7.0 (31/07/2002)
-----------------------------------------

Since Mandel is quite teeny, a precompiled copy is included as well as the
source code. The precompiled program has been compiled with gcc / glibc on
an x86 linux computer, so should work happily enough on most x86 linux
systems.

If you wish to compile yourself, a (very simple) makefile is included, just
type;

make

and mandel should compile up if you have gcc. If you are working on a
different unix platform with a different compiler, you'll probably need to
customise the makefile for your particular setup (any suggested improvements
are more than welcome :-)

If you are working on a Windows platform, older versions of the program
have been bribed to compile under MS VC++. You would need to create a
suitable project and make all the necessary tweeks yourself though. One
major sticking point is the fopenp() standard function; this is used to open
the output file stream to disk, but behaves differently in the Microsoft
world. You'll need to adjust the code to make sure that fopen() opens the
stream as binary, as the Microsoft default is to write ascii (which adds
many spurious 'carriage return' codes and generally makes a mess of things).

Whatever way, I hope you enjoy the software and have fun :-)
